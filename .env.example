# DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
# ========================
# 1. Update VITE_BLOCKCHAIN_API to your actual Render backend URL
# 2. The frontend will use this URL to fetch logs and verify events
# 3. In production (Netlify), netlify.toml will proxy /api/* to this URL
# 4. Environment variables set here are embedded in the production build

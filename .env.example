# Example environment variables for local development
# Copy this file to `.env` or set individual vars in your environment.
# Vite exposes variables that start with VITE_ to the client bundle.
VITE_API_URL=https://majorproject-itcj.onrender.com

# Notes:
# - In Netlify, set an environment variable named `VITE_API_URL` to your backend URL.
# - When building the site, Vite will inline this value into the frontend build.
# - For local dev the `vite` server also proxies `/api` to the backend (see `vite.config.js`).

# Controls whether the backend returns a specific conflict field in registration
# error responses. Defaults to `false` to avoid leaking whether an account
# exists. Set to `true` to help debugging in private/dev environments.
# Values accepted: `1`, `true`, `yes` (case-insensitive)
EXPOSE_CONFLICT_FIELD=false
